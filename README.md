# Scuttle

A crab crossing a beach. Sideways is fast and fluid, forward is one slow step
you cannot take back, and everyone gets the same beach today.

Phase 1 only — the movement prototype. See [What exists](#what-exists).

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:3000
```

Arrow keys on a desktop, or the three buttons at the bottom on a phone. Narrow
the window: this is built for a phone held in one hand.

## What exists

Phase 1 answers one question — is the sideways asymmetry fun? — and builds only
what is needed to answer it:

- Lateral movement that is continuous and instantly responsive, and a forward
  step that takes four tenths of a second, refuses all input while it runs, and
  cannot be cancelled.
- One band of dry-sand lanes, generated from the calendar date. Some lanes hold
  beachgoers walking across; some hold towels and sunbathers that do not move.
  Every fourth lane is clear.
- Three buttons, and a simulation that runs at a fixed sixty ticks a second
  regardless of the frame rate.

Not built, and specified: the tide, the surf and its waves, the seagull, the
dog, the frisbee, collectibles, the end-of-run result, the streak, sharing, and
the one-run-a-day limit. The lanes currently go on indefinitely because there is
no sea to reach yet, and a run can be retried as often as you like because a
prototype that can be played once a day cannot be tuned.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev        # Dev server
npm run build      # Production build
npm run start      # Serve a production build
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit
npm run lint       # eslint
npm run test       # vitest run
```

All four must pass before anything is called done.

## The profile

When a run ends, Scuttle reports that day to the [TaioTech
hub](https://taiotech.com)'s player-profile ledger — the day's best rather than
the last run, with the shells picked up. They appear on the profile the hub shows
for whoever is playing, alongside whatever the other games in the arcade have
minted.

**Play is unaffected when the ledger is unreachable.** Nothing waits on a
submission and a failure is silent: offline, or with the service down, a run
plays start to finish exactly as it always did. The personal best and the streak
live in this device's local storage and are never read back from the hub, so the
game's own screens do not depend on the ledger at all. A run that could not be
sent is queued and tried again the next time the game is opened.

`NEXT_PUBLIC_LEDGER_ORIGIN` points submissions somewhere other than
`https://taiotech.com`, which is what local development against a hub on another
hostname needs.

## Where it lives

Source is [`tycarolan/scuttle`](https://github.com/tycarolan/scuttle); the
prototype deploys to [scuttle.taiotech.com](https://scuttle.taiotech.com). The
[TaioTech hub](https://taiotech.com/scuttle) carries the project page that links
here, and nothing else — this repository owns the code and the spec.

Phase 1 was built inside the hub repository, at `scuttle/`, because this
repository did not exist yet. It was extracted with its history intact, so the
commit describing the movement work is the one that originally landed there.
